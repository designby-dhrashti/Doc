					So what’s my story and why did I choose this unusual profession? The answer is simply to help stop this type of cyber activity which seems to affect people on the daily. <strong class="boldtext">Having the experience twice before - I simply decided that I wasn’t going to sit back and let these cruel selfish people get away with their deceit.</strong> I simply want people to be aware that not everything is as seems on the beautiful world of the internet and especially in this day and era where every bit of our social life is put on the web to portray our “perfect” lives.

						“I was going through a hard time in my life and I was single so naturally I turned to social media - Facebook to be exact - where I came across a profile picture of only the most beautiful woman I had ever laid my eyes on the screen. So I flicked her a message and we essentially started talking and things started to fall back into place in my life and all was going rosy until the day I asked this woman whether we could meet up to see each other face to face and get things moving along - she would constantly come up with excuses about her sick grandma and her little kid and how it would be really difficult for her to meet up even though we lived in the same city. At this point I started to become suspicious as another male had started posting how much he loved her on her Facebook wall. I was losing my mind when I came across an ad for Catfish Hunter and decided to give it ago - what was the harm? Catfish hunter changed my life as I contacted them and found out information about this so called beautiful woman and how she turned out to be a 55 year old woman who was wasting her time on social media and luring males such as myself who only wanted true love. Thanks Catfish Catcher!"

						"I still remember the first day I started talking to him...it just seemed so real. He said we had a few mutual friends but I couldn't see any mutual friends on his or mine Facebook page. We eventually started talking intimately and he asked me to send some sexy nudes. At the time, I had been pretty much as single as you can get so I thought why the hell not!? After this activity (which I am absolutely ashamed of) I didn't hear from him for a couple of week and I was in absolute distraught. I got a text asking me how I was and I thought "well about time" and from there we continued where we'd left off. We had been "going out" for a couple of months at this time and he never wanted to video chat. His Facebook profile indicated he lived in Sydney, Australia - while I lived in Brisbane, Australia. One day I asked him if he wanted to meet as I was irrevocably in love with this man I'd never seen before and he straight out rejected the notion. I started to become suspicious after he kept rejecting the idea of meeting up for no reason and that is when I came across Catching Catfishers on a social media website. I contacted them and received a response almost within the hour! From there I gave all the information I could possibly conjure up about my interaction with this man online and within days I was contacted by the Catcher again. It was to tell me that the supposed "man" I had been having online interactions with turned out to be a 42 year old woman who was actually very much happily living her life with her husband and children and thought this would be a great time passer when her husband would leave for work each day. You can expect the shock I received. The "man" who I had been falling in love with for 4 months turned out to me a female. The Catfish Catcher contacted the lady and set up a meeting for me and her where she profusely apologised for her actions. I then proceeded to enjoy my deluxe spa funded by the Catfish Catcher - Thank you for helping me Catfish Catcher!"

						"I had simply fallen in love with a girl who I thought actually existed based on her Instagram profile. She was posing as an upcoming model and stated she was single in her profile. I contacted her as I am an upcoming photographer and found her beauty to be absolutely astonishing! I contacted her through her email address linked in her profile bio and got no response until a few days later she started messaging me. A lot of the things she was telling me didn't add up so I simply contacted Catching Catfishers where step by step we went through the procedure and found that this girl who was posing as a 22 year old upcoming model was actually a 14 year old girl who was using her 22 year old model cousin as the face of her bio. I simply stopped all contact with the girl and left it at that! Thanks Catching Catfishers for stopping me from committing a crime."
